<h1>Mory Gym — Email Marketing Campaign</h1>

<h2>1. Campaign Overview</h2>
<p>
The Mory Gym Email Marketing Campaign was developed to re-engage existing members, attract new female audiences, and promote premium classes through segmented, value-driven communication. The strategy focused on personalization, behavioral triggers, and consistent visual identity across every email to reinforce trust and motivation.
</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>2. Methodology</h2>
<p>
Audience segmentation was built from CRM and signup forms, categorized into:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Active members (renewal reminders, loyalty offers)</li>
  <li>Former members (winback campaigns)</li>
  <li>New leads (trial signups and awareness series)</li>
  <li>Corporate partners (group fitness programs)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The campaign used <b>Mailchimp</b> integrated with <b>Meta Ads</b> and <b>Google Analytics</b> UTM tracking. Open rate, CTR, and conversion data were cross-validated with pixel tracking. A/B testing was applied on subject lines and CTA copy to identify top-performing variants.
