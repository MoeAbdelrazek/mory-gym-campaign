<h2>Data Sources & Tools Used</h2>
<ul style="font-size:18px;">
  <li><b>Google Analytics 4 (GA4):</b> Used for conversion attribution and funnel visualization.</li>
  <li><b>Meta Ads Manager:</b> Measured reach, CTR, and cost per conversion on Instagram/TikTok.</li>
  <li><b>Mailchimp + HubSpot:</b> For email automation tracking and CRM integration.</li>

  <li><b>Chart.js Visualization:</b> Used for client presentation — doughnut charts for KPIs, sparkline for revenue growth.</li>

<div class="section-divider"></div>

<h2>Data Interpretation & Validation</h2>
<p>To validate results, data triangulation was performed between Google Analytics (conversion attribution), POS transactions (actual payments), and CRM data (email-to-signup correlation). The team ensured no double attribution by implementing UTM tracking across all digital ads.</p>

<p>All metrics were standardized weekly using a KPI dashboard built in Looker Studio, ensuring consistent data reporting across channels. Engagement rate and ROI calculations were cross-checked manually before final client reporting.</p>

<h2>Methods of Execution</h2>
<p>Data-driven ad segmentation was achieved using Facebook Audience Insights and TikTok’s custom lookalike audiences.

Campaign dashboards were automated with <b>Google Sheets + Looker Studio API</b> connections, tracking all KPIs daily.</p>

<p>To visualize data for stakeholders, the marketing team used <b>Chart.js</b> integrated with campaign dashboards, representing membership growth (line graph), engagement rates (doughnut chart), and revenue progressions (sparkline visualization).</p>

  <li>Cross-platform UTM validation ensured consistent attribution paths between Meta, Google, and CRM systems.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="border: 2px solid #bfa15d; margin-top: 40px;">
<h2>Final Summary</h2>
