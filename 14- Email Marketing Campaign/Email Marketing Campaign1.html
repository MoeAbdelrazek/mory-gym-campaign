  <h1>Mory Gym Email Marketing Campaign</h1>

  <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Drive membership growth and engagement among the 18–50 target audience through a structured 12-week automated email sequence. The campaign focused on conversion, retention, and lifetime value increase while aligning with Mory Gym’s premium brand positioning in Alexandria.</p>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>Data-driven planning guided all campaign stages, beginning with segmentation of the CRM database based on demographics, gender balance (50% M / 50% F), and behavior patterns. The email sequence was automated via Mailchimp, with UTM tracking integrated into all CTAs for GA4 monitoring. Creative direction was derived from audience heat maps and engagement analysis from prior campaigns, ensuring maximum resonance across tone, timing, and offer design.</p>
  <p>Performance metrics were monitored through Mailchimp dashboards, GA4 event tracking, and CRM sales reconciliation. Open rates, CTRs, and conversion events were validated using cross-platform attribution models, ensuring accuracy across sessions and devices. Data was visualized weekly through Looker Studio for optimization and reporting.</p>
