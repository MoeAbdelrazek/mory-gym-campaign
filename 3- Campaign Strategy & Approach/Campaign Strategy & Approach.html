<h1>Mory Gym — Campaign Strategy & Approach</h1>

<p><strong>Campaign Objective:</strong> Establish Mory Gym as Alexandria’s premium fitness destination while increasing brand awareness, engagement, memberships, and retention. The marketing plan integrates multi-channel campaigns with a data-driven foundation and visual storytelling.</p>

<div class="separator"></div>

<h2>1. Strategic Overview</h2>
<p>This section of the campaign was built using a full-funnel strategy framework combining awareness, acquisition, and retention pillars. The content structure, animations, and the visual chart were likely created using <strong>HTML5, CSS3 Grid, and Chart.js</strong>. Data used in the dashboard were sourced from campaign analytics — likely a mix of <strong>Meta Ads Manager</strong> (for reach and engagement), <strong>Google Analytics</strong> (for conversion and ROAS), and <strong>CRM reports</strong> (for membership and retention).</p>

<p>The approach integrates audience segmentation, channel prioritization, and conversion optimization through measurable KPIs.</p>
